# Simple Note-Taking Application with Cat Facts (Backend)

This is the backend for a simple note-taking application built using the **Express** (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js). Each note is associated with a random **cat fact** fetched from [Cat Fact API](https://catfact.ninja/fact) every time a new note is created.


## Features

- Create a note with a random cat fact
- Retrieve all active notes
- Soft delete a note (`isDeleted` flag)
- Search notes by title, content, or catfact
- Input validation with `express-validator`
- Winston logging (console + file)
- Error handling middleware

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| POST   | /api/notes       | Create a new note          |
| GET    | /api/notes       | Get all notes              |
| DELETE | /api/notes/:id   | Delete a note by ID        |
| GET    | /api/notes/search?q= | Search notes by text   |


## Input Validation

- `title`: required, max 100 characters
- `content`: required
- `id` in URL param must be a valid MongoDB ObjectId
- `q` (search query): min 2 characters

## Logging

- The backend uses Winston for logging.
- Logs are stored in the logs/ directory, including:
- error.log: Stores error logs.
- combined.log: Stores general logs, including request details and successful operations.
- Logs are printed to the console in development environments, with colorized output for better readability.

## Postman Collection

You can test the API using this [Postman Collection](#) (Attached to same directory `Note Take.postman_collection.json` file).

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication (JWT)
- Rate limiting and security headers
- Dockerize and add CI/CD

## How To Run Application 

### 1. Clone the repository: Run below commands and follow the steps in bash terminal

```bash 

git clone https://github.com/rahulkumar1907/note-taker.git
cd note-taker
npm install

Create a .env file in the root of the backend folder(note-taker) with the following content:
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://**hul******:<password>@cluster0.cjq8k.mongodb.net/note-taker
NODE_ENV=development


npm start     (production mode)    or  npm run start       (development mode)



The server will be running on http://localhost:5000.
